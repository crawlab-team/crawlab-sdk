The SDK for Python contains two parts:
1. CLI Tool
2. Utility Tools

## CLI Tool

The CLI Tool is mainly designed for those who are more comfortable using command line tools to interact with Crawlab. 

The installation of the CLI Tool is simple:

```bash
pip install crawlab-sdk
```

Then, you can use the `crawlab` command in the command prompt to action with Crawlab.

Check the help document below, or you can refer to [the official documentation (Chinese)](http://docs.crawlab.cn/Usage/Spider/CLI.html). 

```
crawlab --help
```
